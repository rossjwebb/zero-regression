# Zero-Regression

## What this is

A deterministic certification harness. A completed run issues a three-line certificate:

- **COVERAGE** — the observed region, as measured
- **KILL RATE** — killed/seeded in that region, with survivor classes
- **UNVERIFIED** — the declared unobserved region

This repository makes no Generator, Adjudicator, or Executor calls.

## How to run

From a fresh clone, with Python 3.12.3 on `PATH`:

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -r requirements-certification.txt
./certify.sh subjects/accounting-service
./verify.py subjects/accounting-service/evidence/run-*/evidence.jsonl
```

## Evidence-chain schema

The log is an append-only sequence of JSON records. Every record carries: `seq` (monotonic integer); `ts` (UTC timestamp); `type` (one of `CONFIG`, `BASELINE`, `MUTANT_RESULT`, `TRIAGE`, `OVERRIDE`, `CERTIFICATE`); `payload` (type-specific body); `prev_hash` (the SHA-256 fingerprint of the preceding record's canonical serialisation); `hash` (the SHA-256 fingerprint of this record's canonical serialisation, including `prev_hash`).

## How to verify a chain without trusting the issuer

Given the log: (1) recompute every record's `hash` from its canonical serialisation and confirm it matches; (2) confirm every `prev_hash` equals the predecessor's `hash` — any break locates tampering to the exact row; (3) confirm the `CERTIFICATE` record's three lines are derivable from the `MUTANT_RESULT` and `TRIAGE` records alone — the certificate must add no information the chain does not contain.

```bash
./verify.py path/to/evidence.jsonl
```

Exit 0 means the chain holds. On failure the first broken `seq` is printed. Steps 1–3 need no trust in the issuer and no execution environment.
